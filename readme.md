# Keynote1: Mobile First HTML Slides for Salesforce1

Take my HTML slides to the next level by running them from within the Salesforce1 app. Because the slides are running inside a Salesforce session, they can incorporate "live" Salesforce data, dashboards, etc.

Keypoint1 is running inside a Visualforce page as a single page application. It is aware of the Salesforce session, and it can leverage ForceTK to display "live" Salesforce data in your presentations. I also made Keypoint1 responsive: you can run your presentations on your phone or on your iPad in the Salesforce1 app, or simply in your browser as a regular Visualforce page.

The home page for the project (with installation instructions) is here:
